# API Optimization Showcase

This project serves as a demonstration of implementing various optimization techniques for an API using Django. The goal is to showcase my proficiency in five key areas:

1. **Pagination**: Efficiently handle large datasets by paginating API responses.
2. **Caching**: Improve performance by caching frequently accessed data.
3. **Asynchronous Logging**: Implement asynchronous logging to reduce I/O overhead.
4. **Payload Compression**: Minimize network bandwidth usage by compressing API payloads.
5. **Connection Pooling**: Enhance scalability and resource management with connection pooling.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Django
- **Python Libraries**: Django REST Framework, Requests
- **API Provider**: JSONPlaceholder (for demonstration purposes)

## Project Structure

- `[app_name]/` : Contains Django app for API endpoints.
  - `views.py`: Defines API views showcasing optimization techniques.

- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clonehttps://github.com/jck-bit/Optimizing-APIs.git
